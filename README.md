## User Experience and Design

## High Level Idea

A website will be created that can link to sources of news related to the professional wrestling industry. It will also have a quiz where people can see how much of a superfan they are!

The site will be designed to be accessible for people new to wrestling as well as attractive and well designed in terms of navigation and consistant styling. For those more interested it will also link to an API in order to show some events they can attend, and link to buy a ticket if they so wish. The quiz will also give a score and incorporate a timer so they can compete!

It will also be important to consider responsiveness in the website form the start - so people can use it easily on mobiles, laptops and large screens. 

The needs of the user, both new and experienced, as well as the website owner will be considered in the design of this project.
