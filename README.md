## User Experience and Design

### High Level Idea

A website will be created that can link to sources of news related to the professional wrestling industry. It will also have a quiz where people can see how much of a superfan they are!

The site will be designed to be accessible for people new to wrestling as well as attractive and well designed in terms of navigation and consistant styling. For those more interested it will also link to an API in order to show some events they can attend, and link to buy a ticket if they so wish. The quiz will also give a score and incorporate a timer so they can compete!

It will also be important to consider responsiveness in the website form the start - so people can use it easily on mobiles, laptops and large screens. 

The needs of the user, both new and experienced, as well as the website owner will be considered in the design of this project. 

### User Stories

As a **business (website) owner** I want a website that can expose my business and drive repeated visits. 

As a **customer (visitor)** I want to see some wrestling content, as well as do a quiz. 

As a **regular user** I want to test my knowledge and compete against my scores, as well as have an easy way to see events. I may also want to suggest future features. 

To meet these needs we need:

1. A clear and consise website that clearly explains what it is about. 
2. An attractive website that is easy to navigate. 
3. A way for customers to interract with the site. 
4. A way for customers to provide feedback about the site. 
5. Social media links and interractivity. 
6. Information about wrestling - potential from external resources. 
7. A quiz that provides some entertainment. 
8. Links to more information about Wrestling. 
9. Listings for events.
10. Links to booking sites. Potentially links for merchandise also. 
11. Access to a newsletter. 
12. A way to suggest changes to the site and features. 
13. A way to track my score on the quiz or time myself. 
14. Music to enjoy during my visit.

### High level needs and Trade-offs: 

There were several needs identified from these stories, and in discussion wiht the client these were ranked from most to least timportant. 

1. An attractive and well designed website with clear navigation. 
2. An interractive quiz. 
3. News sources for wrestling. 
4. A way to search for events. 
5. Mechandising opportunities. 
6. A contact form for feedback. 
7. Music to listen too whilst browsing. 

These were taken and assessed against the limitiations of time and budget, and given related visibility / feasability scores (opportunity numbers relate to the above, and higher numbers are more important / feasible):

| Opportunity      | Importance    | Viability     |
| :-------------:   | :----------:  | :-----------: |
| 1                | 5             | 5              |
| 2                | 5             | 4              |
| 3                | 4             | 4              |
| 4                | 4             | 1              |
| 5                | 3             | 5              |
| 6                | 4             | 5              |
| 7                | 2             | 4              |

From this it was claer there needed to be a little comprimise on the project, and to prioritise certian areas over others in the deployed project. An online shop wiht merchandising was agreed as a future goal and music something which would be good, but not essential in the initial product. 

Therefore the key requirements are:
* An attractive, well designed and easy to navigate site. 
* Information about Wrestling, be that news and / or event listings. 
* A quiz as an interractive element in the site. 
* A contact form for feedback from users.
